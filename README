This tool captures first frame of an swf file. The capturing is done in php on
the server side using  dump-dgnash tool.
To capture following tools have been tried and the best one turned out to be
dump-gnash.
1. swftools ( http://swftools.org/ ) (screenshots are not accurate)
2. swfdef ( http://swfdec.freedesktop.org/wiki/ ) (aspect ratio not maintained,
always square screenshot is generated)
3. gnash ( http://www.gnu.org/s/gnash/) (screenshots are acurate and the aspect
ratio is maintained)

Installation:-
------------
This can only be deployed on linux.
The pre requisite for this to run is install gnash on the deployment server.
Follow below instructions to deploy this on the server.
1. Rename default_config.php to config.php and follow the instructions specified
after the "Editable Configuration" section in config.php file.
2. Rename htaccess to .htaccess
3. Deployment is ready to use.

Security:-
----------
There is a possibility of deployment server being used as an attacker of the
server hosting swf files.To avoid this, use fail2ban as it is better handled
using that instead of inside php script.

TODO:-
------
* fix virtual() errors , check if it is only issue with ubuntu.. if so ignore
* Write a build script.
* Asynchronous handling of swf download
    ** Show progress
* Add cancel/abort support.
* Download swf partially, which is just enough to create the screen shot.
* Create install script.
    ** include production level php configuration such as displayerros off etc.
* Improve look and feel.
* Handle md5 clashes
* Implement intelligent/http caching for caching of swf files
* Write a script to cleanup cache, add this to the cron.
* Limit max execution time for curl
* Get http_referer value from config and set it while sending curl requests
* Test various scenarios
